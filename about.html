            <h1>ABOUT US</h1><a href="./project.html">HOME</a></div>
    <div class="info"><p>The idea of working towards this web is to provide LPU users a platform where they can see how near they have a <span>FOOD COURT</span> at their current location inside the campus. The moto is too simplify user need and to make him aware of the stores open or not he/she wants to vist and also to make sure that they know before where to head for the kind of food they want to eat at that point of time.</p><br>
    <p>Although the site is still not fully deployed and contains only location spot of food courts near all boys hostel and girls hostel.<br>
    The future vision and goal is to built it for all the blocks of LPU and also to add up future aspects such as Food Court details required.</p>
    <br><p><span>PRIOR GOAL:</span> is to make it deployable to such an extent where user can see details of LPU COURT, each and every store inside that food court, what kind of food the store is providing to the user, the menu along with pricing. The user can also get the informtion of best pricing of the same item at nearby food courts of different stores, also he/she can choose whether to go for what!
    </p><br><p><span>FUTURE VISION:</span> It is to integrate it to a level where user can have a platform life Zomate,Swiggy etc. and can use online order system to get their foods from their favourite Stores be it any Food Court, also this will reduce their time consumption, energy and money. The platform will be in a condition where it can create more and more employbility, less hustle and less food storage for all the stores in the campus.</p>
